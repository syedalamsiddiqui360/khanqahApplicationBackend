 *
 * @param resource - Indicates the response contains a Chargeback object.
 *                   Will always contain `chargeback` for this endpoint.
 * @param id - The chargebackâ€™s unique identifier, for example `chb_n9z0tp`.

 * @param settlementAmount - This optional field will contain the amount that will be deducted from your account,
 *                           converted to the currency your account is settled in. It follows the same syntax as
 *                           the `amount` property. Note that for chargebacks, the `value` key of `settlementAmount`
 *                           will be negative. Any amounts not settled by Mollie will not be reflected in this amount,
 *                           e.g. PayPal chargebacks.
 * @param createdAt - The date and time the chargeback was issued, in ISO 8601 format.
 * @param reversedAt - The date and time the chargeback was reversed if applicable, in ISO 8601 format.
 * @param paymentId - The unique identifier of the payment this chargeback was issued for. For example: `tr_7UhSN1zuXS`.
 *                    The full payment object can be retrieved via the `payment` URL in the `_links` object.
 * @param _links - An object with several URL objects relevant to the chargeback.

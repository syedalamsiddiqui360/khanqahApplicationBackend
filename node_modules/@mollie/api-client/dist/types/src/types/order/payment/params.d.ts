/**
 * Create Order Payment parameters
 *
 * An order has an automatically created payment that your customer can use to pay for the order. When the payment
 * expires you can create a new payment for the order using this endpoint.
 *
 * A new payment can only be created while the status of the order is `created`, and when the status of the existing
 * payment is either `expired`, `canceled` or `failed`.
 *
 * @param orderId - Corresponding Order ID
 *
 * @param method - Normally, a payment method screen is shown. However, when using this parameter, you can choose a
 *                 specific payment method and your customer will skip the selection screen and is sent directly to the
 *                 chosen payment method. The parameter enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into
 *                 your website.
 * @param customerId - The ID of the Customer for whom the payment is being created. This is used for recurring payments
 *                     and single click payments.
 * @param mandateId - When creating recurring payments, the ID of a specific Mandate may be supplied to indicate which
 *                    of the consumerâ€™s accounts should be credited.
 *
 * @param testmode - If the new payment is for a test order this parameter is required and you have to set this to true.
 * @param applicationFee - Adding an application fee allows you to charge the merchant a small sum for the payment and
 *                         transfer this to your own account.

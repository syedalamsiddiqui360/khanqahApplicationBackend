 *
 *                   Must be less than the number of items already shipped for this order line.
 * @param amount - The amount that you want to ship. In almost all cases, Mollie can determine the amount
 *                 automatically.
 *
 *                 The amount is required only if you are partially shipping an order line which has a non-zero
 *                 `discountAmount`.
 *
 *                 The amount you can ship depends on various properties of the order line and the create shipment
 *                 request. The maximum that can be shipped is unit price x quantity to ship.
 *
 *                 The minimum amount depends on the discount applied to the line, the quantity already shipped or
 *                 canceled, the amounts already shipped or canceled and the quantity you want to ship.
 *
 *                 If you do not send an amount, Mollie will determine the amount automatically or respond with an
 *                 error if the amount cannot be determined automatically.
